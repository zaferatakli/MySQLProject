# MySQLProject: Employee Database Queries

- `employees`: Employee records (ID, name, gender, birth date, hire date).
- `departments`: Department codes and names.
- `dept_emp`: Department assignment history of employees.
- `dept_manager`: Department managers.
- `salaries`: Salary history of employees.
- `titles`: Job titles held by employees.
